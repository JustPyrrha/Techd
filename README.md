## Modpack Usage
Usage in modpacks is strictly forbidden without explicit permission granted by myself (Pyrrha). \
I (Pyrrha) reserve the right to retract given permission at any time for any reason.

This may sound scary, but it's just a general safety measure to keep my work out of the hands of bigots and the like.
